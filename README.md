# NLP_predict_password_strenth  
**Overview**  
This project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques  to predict the strength of passwords based on various features extracted from them. It employs machine learning algorithms to classify passwords into different strength categories (e.g., weak, normal , strong) using a dataset of labeled passwords.  
**Features**  
  **NLP Techniques:** Utilizes TF-IDF, feature extraction, and sementic analysis methods to process password data.  
  **Machine Learning:** Implemented Logistic Regression algorithm to predict password strength.  
  **Evaluation Metrics:** Measures the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.   
**Dataset**  
The project uses a dataset consisting of labeled passwords categorized by strength levels. The data includes various attributes or features derived from passwords to train and test the models.  
**Steps performed**  
**Setup:** Install the necessary libraries and dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
**Data Processing:** Run the data preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the password dataset.
**Model Training:** Train different machine learning models using the provided dataset.
**Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess performance.
**Prediction:** Use trained models to predict the strength of new passwords.  
**Contributions**
